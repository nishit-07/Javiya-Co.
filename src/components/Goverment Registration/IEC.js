            <p>An Importer Exporter Code is a unique 10-digit code, which is requisite for every import/export business owner in India. The code is issued by the Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of Commerce and needs no filing or renewal. IEC is required by importers to clear customs and shipment, and to transfer money to foreign banks. Exporters require IEC to send shipments and receive money from foreign banks. In short, no importer/exporter can operate in India without getting the IEC.</p>
