            <p>Small scale industries play a vital role in the socio-economic development of India. To promote and encourage these small-scale industries, the government of the country created the MSMED Act. The Act was created to maintain a list of all the industries registered as MSME or SSI. The record aided in providing support and incentives to these firms. Furthermore, SSI helped in employment of people at little capital investments. All these entities should possess certificate of MSME registration, which should be registered with the Central Governmentâ€™s MSME department under the Act of MSME Development- 2006</p>
            <p>The MSMED Act includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small Scale Industries (SSI)</li>
                <li>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)</li>
                <li>Different sectors have different limits for registering under the act.</li>
                <li>A manufacturing enterprise with plants and machinery that required an investment of below 10 Crores can be an MSME.</li>
                <li>For service enterprises, the amount caps at five crores.</li>
                <li>If the company exceeds the upper limit, at any point in the future, it is not considered as an MSME.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To avail the numerous benefits from the Government of India, an SSI registration certificate is needed. It is an optional registration but the companies that get registered are eligible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lesser interest rates</li>
                <li>Excise exemption scheme</li>
                <li>Subsidies in tax, capital investment and power tariff</li>
                <li>Other support</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>New Udyog Aadhaar replaces SSI / MSME Registration</h5>
            <p>In order to make the process of registering a small or medium level enterprise even more straightforward, a new act called the Udyog Aadhaar was created in 2015. Udyog Aadhaar completely replaces MSME and is conducted entirely online. Under the Udyog Aadhaar, only one page needs to be filled for registration with Aadhaar Card acting as the sole legal document.</p>
            
            <h5>Following are the MSME schemes offered by the government Udyog Aadhaar</h5>
