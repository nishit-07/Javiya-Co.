            <p>Power of Attorney Act 1882, power of attorney includes any instrument empowering a specified person to act for and in the name of the person executing it. POA is very well known as Power of Attorney or Power of Authority which is the authority to act for another person in specified or all legal or financial matters. The one who gives an authority to some trustable person is known as a principal or a donor. There are various situations in one’s life where an individual possessing properties, bank accounts, etc. may not be in a position to perform his duties due to reasons like being abroad, physically ill, old in age etc. In such situations, if the transaction requires the presence of the individual who is not able to be present personally, then the only way out is to give the powers to act on behalf of the individual to another person. This is when a Power of Attorney deed is to be created.</p>
