        <p>Launched on July 1 2017, the Goods & Services Tax (GST) applies to all Indian service providers (including freelancers), traders and manufacturers. The GST is an all-in-one tax that subsumes a variety of state (VAT, Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi) and central taxes (CST, Service Tax, Excise Duty). GST is to be charged at every step of the supply chain, with full set-off benefits available. The procedure for GST is entirely online and requires no manual intervention, Every product goes through multiple stages along the supply chain, which includes the purchasing of raw materials, manufacturing, sale to the wholesaler, selling to the retailer and then the final sale to the consumer. GST will be levied on each of these stages (including value addition) and at the point of consumption, rather than the origin of the product. For example, if the product is produced in Tamil Nadu but consumed in Karnataka, then the entire tax revenue will go to Karnataka instead of Tamil Nadu, Also taxpayers with a turnover of less than Rs.1.5 crore can opt for composition scheme to get rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover.</p>

        <h3>What are the components of GST?</h3>
        <p>GST will have 3 tax components, which includes a central component (Central Goods and Services Tax or CGST) and a state component (State Goods and Services Tax or SGST) where centre and state will levy GST on all entities, i.e. when a transaction happens within a state. Inter-state transactions will attract the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST), to be levied by the centre, i.e. when a transaction happens one state to another.</p>

        <h3>What is the input tax credit?</h3>
        <p>Input tax credit lets you reduce your tax you have already paid on inputs and pay the remaining amount at the time of paying tax. You pay taxes on the purchase when a product is purchased from a registered seller, and when you sell the product, you too collect the tax. With input credit, you can adjust the taxes paid at the time of purchase with the amount of tax on sales (output tax) and pay the balance liability of tax, i.e. tax on sale minus tax on the purchase.</p>
