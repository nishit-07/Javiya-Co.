        <h4>Trademark Registration Services</h4>
        <p>A trademark can be defined as the unique identity that makes your product or service stand out from the rest. The unique identity or expression can be a logo, photograph, slogan, word, sound, smell, colour combination or graphics. Most of the businesses usually look for registration of logo or name only. If you have come up with a unique idea or logo, then the only way to protect it as your own unique identity is to patent it. A registered trademark is your business’s intellectual property or intangible asset. It acts as a protective cover of the company’s investment made in the logo or brand. In India, trademarks are registered by the Controller General Of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Ministry Of Industry and Commerce, Government Of India. You can register the trademark under the act named, The Trademark Act, 1999. The registration provides the right to sue against others who try to copy your trademark. Also, no one else can use a similar trademark to the one registered by another person. Once you register a trademark, you can use an R symbol along with it, and it will be valid till 10 years from the date of registration. You can easily get a ™ within 3 days. But, to get an ®, it takes up to 2 years. In case the trademark registration is nearing expiry date, you can always get it re-registered for another ten years.</p>

        <h4>What can you Trademark? Who can all apply for Trademark?</h4>

            <h4 style={{fontWeight:300}}>Trademark Search</h4>
            <p>We help in your trademark search by conducting the search using trademark(™) director. We also conduct a detailed check on the trademark logo and brand name that you had selected to ensure that it is not yet registered under anybody else’s name. The trademark can be registered once it is found to be unique. In case your logo or brand name is already registered by someone else, we help you find ways to modify it so that your registration does not get cancelled.</p>
    
            <h4 style={{fontWeight:300}}>Class Selection</h4>
            <p>While applying for registration, you need to apply it under the right classification of classes. We help you choose the right class under which you need to register. The trademark offers you the right to sell under a particular brand name within a certain sector in the economy. In total, there are about 45 sectors and each sector is named as a class. Goods and services are classified into 45 different classes by the Trademark Registry. Every logo or brand name has to be registered under the appropriate class. For example, the Class 28 includes products and services related to games, sports and toys. Hence, if you are planning to launch a new toy brand, you will have to apply under the Class 28.</p>
