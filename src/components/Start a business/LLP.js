    <p>LLP was launched in India by way of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. The main edge of a Limited Liability Partnership is one partner is not liable for another partner’s misconduct or negligence. LLP is favoured by Professionals, Micro and Small businesses that are family-owned or closely-held. Limited Liability partnership offers the benefit of limited liability to its owners and at the same time needs minimal maintenance. The owners of a private limited company have limited liability to creditors. In case of default, banks/creditors can only sell the company’s assets and not the personal assets of directors. An LLP also gives limited liability protection for the owners from the debts of the LLP. Accordingly, all partners in an LLP enjoy a kind of limited liability protection for every individual’s protection within the partnership, related to that of the shareholders of a private limited company.</p>
